"""
The following pseudocode describes how to
transform a string containing a ten-digit
telephone number (such as "4155551212") into a
more easily readable string, formatted in the
U.S. style, such as "(415) 555â€“1212":
I. Take the string consisting of the first
three characters and surround it with round brackets
(this is the prefix, called "area code");
II. Concatenating the prefix with the string
containing the next three characters, a hyphen,
and the string consisting of the last four characters
results in the number in the required format.
Translate this pseudocode into a Python program
that stores a 10-digit phone number in a string,
and then display it in the format just described.
