"""
03.1.6 De Morgan. The De Morganâ€™s law makes it easy to apply the
not to expressions containing and/or operators. In particular,
this law has two expressions, one for the negation of expressions
in and, and one for the negation of expressions in or:
not (A and B) is equal to not A or not B not (A or B) is equal
to not A and not B
Consider the following expressions, and for each of them apply
De Morgan's law. Try to describe "in words" the intuitive
algebraic meaning of each of the expressions.
Then write a program that takes as input an integer x and
for each of the following expressions (which correspond to
the negation of the expressions in exercise 03.1.5)
prints: the starting expression, the expression after
applying De Morgan's law, and their truth value:
I. not(x>0andx<100) II. not(x>0orx<100) III. not(x>0or100<x)
IV. not(x>0andx<100orx==-1)
